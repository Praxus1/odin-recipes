    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a dish that can seem frightening to prepare at first glance-tempering eggs can feel a bit touchy and dangerous-but trust me, once you've run throught the process it's super simple! Delicious, too!</p>
    <p>Often the hardest part can be grating the cheese. It's harder than you might be used to, and can be exhausting without the right tools. I'd suggest biting the bullet and purchasing a rotary hard-cheese grater to add to your kitchen gadgets collection. Doing so turned carbonara from a chore to a speedy last-minute meal.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 Pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 wedge parmisiano-reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 package thin spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>2 eggs and 6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil 8 cups heavily salted water</li>
        <li>While water is heating, dice bacon into 1/4 inch pieces. Saute in a skillet, stirring frequently to avoid sticking, until browned. Retain fat.</li>
        <li>Finely grate parmisiano-reggiano, reserve</li>
        <li>Combine whole eggs and egg yolks in a medium-sized bowl, beat eggs until uniform</li>
        <li>Add 3/4 of grated cheese to beaten eggs and stir to combine, add generous amount of black pepper</li>
        <li>Cook pasta until al-dente, then remove from heat and drain, reserving 2 cups of cooking water</li>
        <li>Return pasta to stock pot and add bacon plus about 3 tablespoons of rendered fat, mix well to incorporate noodles and bacon</li>
        <li>To temper the egg mixture: Slowly drizzle 1/2 C cooking water into the egg/cheese mixture, stirring constantly so the eggs do not scramble. Once tempered, use the same technique to add the egg/cheese/cooking water mixture to the hot noodles, stirring constantly to coat the noodles with the mixture. The alread-warmed egg mixture plus the constant stirring will cover the noodles in a thin coating of egg and cheese to form a sauce, instead of clumping and becoming scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>Add cooking water (optional) to create desired sauce consistency (I find that the sauce tends to get stiff and go sticky if I don't add a significant amount of cooking water, don't be shy!)</li>
    </ol>
