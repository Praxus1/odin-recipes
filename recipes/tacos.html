    <p>Is it Tuesday yet? Tacos excel in both their simplicity and their ability to become as complex as you want them to be. Here's the most basic taco recipe you can imagine, based on my midwestern upbringing in the 80s. Good for nostalgia, not great for taste, but a good starting point if you're not confident in the kitchen yet.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 package taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>5 white mushrooms, diced</li>
        <li>Taco shells/tortillas of your choice</li>
        <li>Toppings of choice (tomato, cilantro, fresh diced onion, go crazy!)</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat medium skillet over medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and saute until cooked through</li>
        <li>While meat is cooking, dice onion and mushroom, add to meat as it cooks</li>
        <li>Stir meat and vegetable mixture frequently to avoid sticking or burning. Meanwhile, chop any toppings you've chosen</li>
        <li>Once meat is browned through, drain fat as necessary and add taco seasoning per package directions</li>
        <li>If using tortillas, wrap them in a damp tea towel and microwave for 30 seconds before serving</li>
        <li>Add meat to shells/tortillas, top with your chosen toppings and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
